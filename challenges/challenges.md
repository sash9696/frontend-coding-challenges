# Frontend Challenges - Introduction

Welcome to the Coding Challenges!

Each week, I present a coding challenge designed to help front-end developers enhance their skills through focused practice.

These challenges are exercises I've used to learn new front-end technologies or frameworks, and each one requires you to create a complete application or tool. Many of these challenges are inspired by real-world applications and utilities.

The challenges are designed to be manageable, allowing you to complete them in your spare time over a week or two, while still being substantial enough to result in fully functional projects.

Each challenge includes an introduction that outlines the task, along with a background section when needed to provide essential context. You’ll find a detailed description of the challenge, followed by instructions and scripts to help you test your solution.

I’d appreciate your feedback on these challenges and any suggestions for improvement to better support your growth as a front-end developer.
