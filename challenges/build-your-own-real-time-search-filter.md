# Build Your Own Real Time Search Filter 

The "Build Your Own Real-Time Search Filter" challenge is ideal for developers who want to master dynamic search functionality using real data. In this challenge, you'll create a real-time search filter that lets users search through a list of posts, updating results instantly as they type.

We'll use the **JSONPlaceholder API** as our main data source, specifically the `/posts` endpoint. 

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

However, feel free to use other datasets, such as [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/), Open Library API, or [The Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/), to fit different themes.

## The Challenge - Building a Real-Time Search Filter

Your goal is to create a real-time search filter that retrieves and filters a list of posts from JSONPlaceholder based on user input.

### Requirements:

- **Instant Search Updates**: Display matching results in real-time as the user types.
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Make the search case-insensitive.
- **Empty State Handling**: Show a message when no results match the query.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the filter works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.


## Step Zero

Set up your environment to start developing and testing your real-time search filter.

1. **Choose Your Language/Framework**: You can implement this in plain JavaScript or with a framework like React, Vue, or Angular.
2. **Set Up Your Project**: Create a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file structure, linking them together. Test that the app runs locally.

## Step One: Fetch Data from JSONPlaceholder

In this step, fetch the list of posts from JSONPlaceholder.

1. Use the `/posts` endpoint to retrieve a list of posts:
    
    ```jsx

    const API_URL = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts';
    
    async function fetchPosts() {
        const response = await fetch(API_URL);
        const posts = await response.json();
        return posts;
    }
    
    ```
    
2. Ensure the posts data loads on the page, either in console or displayed in HTML.



## Step Two: Display Posts and Add a Search Input

Now, create a basic HTML layout with a search input and a container to display posts.

1. Add a search input field in your HTML file.
2. Display the fetched posts in a list format or cards in the container.

Example:

```html

<!-- index.html -->
<input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Search posts...">
<ul id="results"></ul>

```

```jsx

// app.js
const resultsContainer = document.getElementById('results');
const searchInput = document.getElementById('search');

function displayPosts(posts) {
    resultsContainer.innerHTML = posts.map(post => `<li>${post.title}</li>`).join('');
}

// Initial fetch and display
fetchPosts().then(posts => displayPosts(posts));

```



## Step Three: Real-Time Filtering

Add functionality to filter the list of posts in real-time as the user types.

1. Listen to the `input` event on the search field.
2. Filter posts based on the current input, updating the displayed results dynamically.

Example:

```jsx

function filterPosts(posts, query) {
    return posts.filter(post => post.title.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()));
}

searchInput.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
    const query = e.target.value;
    const filteredPosts = filterPosts(posts, query);
    displayPosts(filteredPosts);
});

```



## Step Four: Case-Insensitive Matching and Empty State

Ensure the search is case-insensitive and add a message when no matches are found.

1. Update `filterPosts` to ensure matching is case-insensitive.
2. Modify `displayPosts` to display a message like "No posts found" if `filteredPosts` is empty.



## Optional: Step Five - Advanced Filtering (Optional)

Enhance your filter with additional functionality:

1. **Highlight Matching Text**: Use HTML tags to highlight the search term within each matching result.
2. **Category-Based Filtering**: Add additional filtering by post ID or user ID, if desired.



## Optional: Step Six - Setting up ESLint for Code Quality

Set up ESLint to improve code quality:

1. Install ESLint:
    
    ```bash

    npm install eslint --save-dev
    
    ```
    
2. Create an `.eslintrc` configuration file, defining linting rules.
3. Run ESLint on your project to identify and fix issues:
    
    ```bash

    npx eslint . --fix
    
    ```
    

## Optional: Step Seven - Adding Unit Tests

Ensure the functionality of your search filter with unit tests.

1. Set up a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
    
    ```bash

    npm install --save-dev jest
    
    ```
    
2. Write unit tests for core features, such as filtering logic, case-insensitivity, and empty state handling.
3. Run the tests:
    
    ```bash
    npm test
    
    ```
    


## The Final Step: Clean Up and Document

1. **Write Comments**: Add comments explaining the functionality of your code.
2. **README File**: Include a `README.md` file with setup, usage instructions, and an explanation of the project.
